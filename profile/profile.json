The system is built on Linux using SQL and bash scripts. Docker is used to create and manage the container in which the system runs. Crontab automates the collection of usage data from the host device by running the appropriate script every minute while the system is active. Finally, the queried data addresses various questions related to the hardware information and usage data in the PostgreSQL database.",

The application requires the user to supply three parameters. These parameters include a pattern to search for, the search directory, and the output file to store all matched lines. The application was written in Java, using IntelliJ as the IDE. The testing process involved a series of trial and error tests. IntelliJ's debugger was especially useful in identifying issues related to properly searching the given directory. The application was cleaned and packaged using Maven and deployed using Docker. A Docker image was also built and pushed to Docker Hub."

During my time at university, I learned languages such as C++, C#, and R, using IDE's such as Visual Studio and RStudio. I was introduced to concepts such as object oriented programming, user research and algorithms \u0026 data structures. I used source control tools such as Git, GitHub, and GitKraken, and other collaboration tools such as Discord \u0026 Trello. I was also given the opportunity to use the agile framework in the form of daily scrum meetings. For the three summers from 2018-2020, I worked as an Environmental Intern; the first two summers for Sustainable Cobourg, and the third summer for the Township of Hamilton. My responsibilities included research, data collection, data entry, and data visualization. These summer positions also provided opportunities for me to develop my organization, communication, and time management skills. I am passionate about collecting and organizing data. As a result, I am interested in pursuing a career in the data industry."
