    description: "Developed a system that collects hardware specifications and resource usage data from Linux hosts and sends it to a PostgreSQL database.
                  The system is built on Linux using SQL and bash scripts. Docker is used to create and manage the container in which the system runs.
                  Crontab automates the collection of usage data from the host device by running the appropriate script every minute while the system is active.
                  Finally, the queried data addresses various questions related to the hardware information and usage data in the PostgreSQL database."
