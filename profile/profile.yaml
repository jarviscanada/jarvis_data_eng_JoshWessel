    description: "Developed a system that collects hardware specifications and resource usage data from Linux hosts connected to a local network.
                  A PostgreSQL database contains the data. This process takes place within a container created and managed by Docker.
                  A PSQL instance is created within the container and stores the collected data in two different tables. The system uses five different scripts to complete the project.
                  The scripts are used to start Docker, set up PSQL tables, collect hardware information and usage data, and query data.
                  Crontab automates the collection of usage data from the host device by running the appropriate script every minute while the system is active.
                  Then, the queried data addresses various questions related to the hardware information and usage data from all connected hosts."
