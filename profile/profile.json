      "description": "Developed a text-based basketball simulation game featuring an assortment of mistake-prone basketball players called Babduls. Though initially developed to gain more programming experience and refresh my object-oriented programming skills, I continue to work on it periodically in my spare time. The program is written using C++ in Visual Studio and uses object-oriented programming. GitKraken provides source control.",

      "description": "Developed a first-person firefighting simulator where the user controls a firefighter and must extinguish all fires in a burning building. The simulator was an individual project developed for a final assignment in a fourth-year Immersive Technology course at Ontario Tech University. The project's objective featured the development of a firefighting simulation that firefighters could use to help increase their resilience to stress on the job. The project focused on using visuals and sound to accomplish the objective. Smoke, flames, and the sound of fire combine to help users increase their resilience to similar stressful situations. The simulation is built in the Unity game engine and uses C# scripts written using Visual Studio.",

In this project, I worked as an environment artist whose primary responsibilities included 3D modeling and texturing. The project used the agile framework. We participated in daily scrums and planned weekly/bi-weekly sprints. GitKraken provided source control.",

      "description": "Developed a system that collects hardware specifications and resource usage data from Linux hosts and sends it to a PostgreSQL database. The system is built on Linux using SQL and bash scripts. Docker is used to create and manage the container in which the system runs. Crontab automates the collection of usage data from the host device by running the appropriate script every minute while the system is active. Finally, the queried data addresses various questions related to the hardware information and usage data in the PostgreSQL database.",

        "JDBC App: Implemented a framework for interacting with a PSQL database using Data Access Objects (DAO's). The project follows the implementation provided by Frank P. Moley III in his Learning JDBC LinkedIn Learning course (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-jdbc?u=107506978). The PSQL database used in this project is populated using data from the LinkedIn Learning course's exercise files. The project employs two DAO's used by an executor class to perform various operations on the database. The project is written in Java using IntelliJ. Testing involved running the code provided from the exercise files, then comparing the results with either the results shown in the videos or the expected results, given changes to the implementation. Maven cleans and packages the project. Docker provides a container in which to store the database.",
        "Grep App: Developed an application that searches all files within a given directory for all lines that match a given pattern, writing all matches to a given output location. The application requires the user to supply three parameters. These parameters include a pattern to search for, the search directory, and the output file to store all matched lines. The application was written in Java, using IntelliJ as the IDE. The testing process involved a series of trial and error tests. IntelliJ's debugger was especially useful in identifying issues related to properly searching the given directory. The application was cleaned and packaged using Maven and deployed using Docker. A Docker image was also built and pushed to Docker Hub."

Technologies used include Google Suite, Microsoft Office, and a web-based framework that functioned as a database, in which I performed data entry (in the second and third summers). Almost all of my work was individual, allowing me the opportunity to improve my time management skills. I was often left to myself to complete a list of tasks, allowing me the opportunity to practice effective time management. The third summer was entirely remote, which allowed me to develop my communication skills using communication tools such as email and zoom. I was also able to use my organizational skills while working with many files and folders daily.",

  "summary": "I graduated from Ontario Tech University with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, majoring in Game Development and Entrepreneurship. During my time at university, I learned languages such as C++, C#, and R, using IDE's such as Visual Studio and RStudio. My educational background introduced me to object-oriented programming, user research, algorithms \u0026 data structures, and many other technical concepts. I used source control tools such as Git, GitHub, and GitKraken, and other collaboration tools such as Discord \u0026 Trello. I was also given the opportunity to use the agile framework in the form of daily scrum meetings. For the three summers from 2018-2020, I worked as a summer intern for Sustainable Cobourg (2018, 2019) and the Township of Hamilton (2020). My responsibilities included research, data collection, data entry, and data visualization. These summer positions also provided opportunities for me to develop my organization, communication, and time management skills. I am passionate about collecting and organizing data. As a result, I am interested in pursuing a career in the data industry."
